# ConstraintLayoutTutorial
This is a basic tutorial of ConstraintLayout.

## Modules or features and their uses:
1. **Barrier** - useful when one of the elements is aligned against multiple views and we are not sure which element will have the largest width/height.
2. **Group** - groups views for easily changing their visibilities.
3. **Chain** - arranges the elements so they fill width or height of parent in different ways.
4. **Guideline** - helps in placing elements at margin (dp or percentage) in the parent.
